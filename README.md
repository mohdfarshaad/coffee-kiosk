# Coffee Kiosk Project

This project implements a smart coffee vending kiosk system, combining a Next.js SaaS app (kiosk-cloud) with a Python FastAPI device agent (kiosk-device) running on Raspberry Pi to control relays, sensors, and manage real-time coffee dispensing.

## Kiosk Cloud

Next.js Cloud App: Fullstack web interface for users, payments, and admin dashboards.

## Kiosk Device

Python Device Agent: Controls GPIO pins, sensors (cup detection, temperature), relays, and communicates with the cloud app.
